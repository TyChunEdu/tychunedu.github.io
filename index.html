            Hi, I'm Tyler, and welcome to my portfolio!
            This is where you'll learn more about me,
            my accomplishments, and my journey in both my
            personal and professional life.

                    "The mind of a mathematician and the heart of a musician..."
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the world of software development, I approach problems with
                    precision and analytical thinking. I believe that the logic and problem-solving
                    skills I've developed through studies are crucial in creating "socially
                    responsible"
                    code. This mindset not only helps me write better software but
                    also allows me to find creative solutions to complex technical challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for creativity is expressed through music. I see music as more
                    than a beautiful blend of art and science. The mathematical principles that
                    underlie
                    music, from rhythms to harmonies, are fascinating, but music has become more and
                    more
                    ingrained in and with computer software. I love creating and
                    performing music that resonates with our hearts and our imagination with
                    mathematical and software principles and tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This synergy allows me to approach projects with a unique perspective. I'm
                    excited
                    to discover how these two worlds intersect and make a positive impact on both
                    fields and beyond.

                A Reflection on Software Development, Generally
            </h3>
            <p>
                <i>Saturday, December 9, 2023</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to describe myself at this very moment, I would say I feel tepid
                and weary. The class <b>Software Development</b>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/cs#:~:text=CS 4500. Software Development. (4 Hours)">
                CS 4500</a>
                has finally come to a close, with our final code walk occurring 6 hours ago.
                I have a lot to
                say, and I want to be genuine, open, and honest as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am purposefully writing this post before grades come out as I do not
                want my grade in the end to influence my statements.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Background
            </h4>
            <p>
                For those that do not know, CS 4500 is a class that is constantly
                talked about for many reasons. It is known for its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/12gv0y1/cs4500_or_cs4530/">
                workload</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/rhuhql/software_development_a_letter_to_khoury_college/">environment
                </a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/rhuhql/software_development_a_letter_to_khoury_college/">rigorousness
                </a>. It is generally accepted as the harder class compared to
                <b>Fundamentals of Software Engineering</b>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/cs#:~:text=CS 4530. Fundamentals of Software Engineering. (4 Hours)">
                    CS 4530</a>; computer science
                majors have to take one of these two courses to graduate. While CS
                4530 is said to be easier, CS 4500 is said to actually allow for students
                to learn a lot and become a better software developer.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Me, Before
            </h4>
            <p>
                Theoretically, as a combined major, I would take CS 4530. I am not a
                straight CS major, so CS 4530 would be generally the "right" choice. I
                did not follow through with this, obviously, and to be honest I was
                going to take CS 4530 originally.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why I took the class was simple: to be in a class with my
                friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not get me wrong, I knew what I was getting into. I planned (or at
                least thought I planned) my schedule such that my other courses were
                easier and less time-consuming to allow time for CS 4500 work. In
                addition, I am confident with my programming skills, despite not taking
                other CS classes that pure CS majors would take.
            </p>
            <h4>
                The Class
            </h4>
            <p>
                This class is hard. That is obvious. However, what is also absolutely true,
                at least from my perspective, is that what they teach and what you
                learn is very much worthwhile. The skills of being able to read code you
                have <i>never</i> seen before, critique code for bugs and design questions,
                and present code to other developers are hard to learn but important.
                That is, <b>I am satisfied with the content of the class</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, the question I have trouble answering is, "Is this class
                worth it?"
            </p>
            <p>
                To be honest I am not sure. The class is mentally and socially taxing, as
                others have described. In my head, I viewed CS 4500 as a class that
                required 2–3× as much time and effort compared to my other classes
                <i>combined</i>. The class does not even compare to any other class I have
                taken so far and probably will ever take.
            </p>
            <p>
                The class does what it said at the very beginning it would do. We are
                purposefully put on a time crunch. Specs are intentionally vague.
                Missing or misunderstood minuscule details cost you, and there was a
                ton of grunt work just to better understand the content of the course
                and ensure a complete codebase. There was so much stress that I
                became num to what stress actually felt like anymore, and not in a good
                way, but rather in an emotionless way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pretty much all social opportunities were cast aside because of this
                class. Setting time for a somewhat social life, taking any form of
                a wellness break, or <i>even working on homework for another class</i>
                risks you not only failing to complete a milestone
                (assignment) by the specified deadline, but also not knowing the
                codebase to a T as expected of you, as the idea of pair-programming is
                that both developers of a codebase know every inch of it equally and completely.
                I understand that classes come first
                and generally all students spend most of their time on classes (and in
                turn, have more free time during co-op), but I do not think there is any
                class quite like CS 4500.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Me, After
            </h4>
            <p>
                I was not a good presenter. I love teaching, but explaining something to
                another person is different when you are being judged by the people
                you are teaching it to, which is generally not a bad thing. However, like
                with any teaching, in order to do it effectively you have to know every
                single detail about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The course entails two codebase swaps. One third
                through the semester one student in each pair goes to a different code
                base, and two thirds through the semester the other student that did
                not swap before goes to another codebase too. It is genuinely difficult
                to join another codebase. I was the second person to swap,
                and the following are notes about my experience:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compared to the first swapped person who only needs to learn a
                    third of the codebase, the second swapped person needs to
                learn two thirds.</li>
                <li>There is a point where making significant changes to a codebase
                for whatever reason is not worth making, as you are almost
                    done with the project and decisions made beforehand are pretty
                set in stone after the first code swap. A lot of time is put in merely
                trying to understand how a codebase works, since changing the
                    codebase to fit understandings of the previous one is not
                    worth it simply because of the lack of time.</li>
                <li>It is harder to follow when my partner has obviously been on the
                codebase significantly longer than me. From there, when working
                on future milestones, it makes sense that my partner knows what to code
                    faster than me. In my opinion, in that situation, it is hard to
                    co-lead a task on a codebase you simply do not understand well
                    even though you are not working on nor presenting those past milestones.
                This is absolutely nothing against my partner, it is merely a
                difficulty of this class's structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I completely understand that this represents the difficulties of the real
            world of software development. However, it is a degrading experience,
            especially since ultimately everything you do translates to a grade.</p>
            <p>
                I truly feel like I did my best based on all of my circumstances. Whether
                that is enough for this class, I have no idea. I do not feel like
                this class reflects how hard I tried and how much I sacrificed (and that is without
                knowing my final letter grade). Yes, there is always
                something to improve, but there is a point where this mindset becomes
                self-destructive.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Retrospective
            </h4>
            <p>
                This class reminds me of another class this similar in that both treat the
                class too much like a real-life organization. While there were clear
                differences compared to how a real-life company would run that were
                noted in lectures, there were still inherent problems. There was an overemphasis on
                mirroring organizational structures and dynamics within a company that
                sometimes led to an unrealistic and impractical learning experience.
                I also feel like there needs to be more consideration for the fact that students
                take other classes besides CS 4500, and the intensive time commitment demanded by
                this class hinders their ability to live a holistic college life.
                The extensive time investment may contribute to the already present lack of social
                skills displayed by many Computer Science majors, as the focus for this class might
                limit opportunities for general social interaction and personal development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intensity of the course may create a
                situation where grades do not accurately reflect the depth of students' learning
                and dedication. If the grading system
                fails to capture the students' efforts, significant learning experiences gained in
                the class can definitely be overshadowed
                by a sole focus on letter grades. This is huge in the context of college, as grades
                often carry substantial weight in evaluating academic success. I am not sure if
                there is a balance between both the qualitative
                aspects of learning and the quantitative measures represented by grades in
                this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                But despite those in my opinion reasonable and justified thoughts, I will
                say that this class motivated me to pursue computer science <i>more</i>.
                During the semester I legitimately came up with two ideas for games
                that I would honestly put a great deal of effort on. This can very much
                be because I wanted to think of projects I could do <i>without having to
                experience the pressure of a grade</i>; one of my friends jokingly said I
                was experiencing <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">
                stockholm syndrome</a>. The essence of the class, or at
                least how it felt, was the ability to tear down other people's code and
                presentations, so I very much share the same feeling with the other
                students that this class was humiliating, for good or for worse. But at
                least I know I gained <i>something</i> from the class.
            </p>
            <p>As for the people involved in the class... I have a great amount of
            respect for every student taking this course, especially my partners.
            This class is not easy, and it was really nice getting to meet other
                students. At the end of the day, we are all different and individual CS
                students trying to make their way through college, and I do not fault
            but rather admire anyone just trying to go through life the way they
                want it to. I know other people feel this way too.</p>
            <p>I have a great amount of respect for the course staff. The same above
            absolutely applies to the TAs too, and I cannot help but wish them luck
                on whatever path life has for each of them. As for the instructors, I can
            only really speak about Prof. Lerner since he was my section instructor.
            I truly appreciate the time he has dedicated to not only the course itself,
            but being open to have a conversation with. While the instructors of
            this course have been known as the "hardest" professors in Khoury (to put
                it lightly) and have had plenty of (sometimes fair) student criticism, I
                can see that they really have good intentions at the end of
                the day, although many may very well disagree.</p>
            <p>
                I truly do not know whether this class was worth it. Usually, for most
                things, I would say that I would never have done something differently
                in the past.
                However, I cannot at this moment say that this applies to CS 4500.
                In other words, the worthwhile reward that I hope to get and that this
                course intends to give has not been realized (and it is not
                necessarily a good grade). I just have to wait and see as years go on.
