                One of the most invaluable insights I have gained after going to Northeastern University is
                understanding the job search. I am always very appreciative of my mentors and peers who have very much
                helped me become where I am today.
            </p>
            <p class="large">
                I have been asked to give advice to many job seekers, so I have decided to create this page as a way to
                help my peers in standing out from the crowd. I acknowledge that this is a LOT. However, I do think that
                in this job market people need a lot more than they expect. It may take time, but it is all ultimately
                worth it in the end. I hope this is helpful.

                            Put at least your city, state, and zip code on your resume.
                            Recruiters want to know where you are located to see if you are local or if they need to consider relocation.

                        <p>
                            If you are a student, put your availability (month/year – month/year) at the top of your resume.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            If you are pursuing a role in technology, nowadays it is <b>expected</b> for you to have a website/portfolio.
                            Feel free to put class projects and make the website pretty (show off your knowledge in UI/UX). 
                            Put anything that you did not have room for on your resume here.
                            A website/portfolio is also essential for creative fields, though if you are pursuing a role in the arts, you should already have one.

                            If you are pursuing a role in technology, presumably you have some coding experience.
                            Push your code onto GitHub, and put your GitHub profile link on your resume. Every project counts.

                        <p>
                            Recruiters often look for specific areas of knowledge.
                            A coursework list highlights what you have learned and what kind of projects you have worked on.
                            Sometimes recruiters look for one specific course that is relevant to the role they are hiring for.

                        <p>
                            Recruiters still want to know you strongest soft skills when determining a best fit.
                            Considering automated resume readers, having soft skill keywords can help move your resume forward.

                        <p>
                            For each work experience, you should only really have 2–3 bullet points.
                            Recruiters do not have the time to read through more than 3 bullet points per experience.
                            In addition, extra bullets tend to take up space that could be better used for other sections.
                            You should have more bullet points for more relevant experiences (and less for less relevant ones).

                            This item applies to mostly technical and creative fields, but can also help with other fields as well.
                            If you have done any projects that are recent or relevant to the role you are applying for, make sure to include them on your resume.
                            You can have a line or so for each project briefly describing what it is, what software you used, etc.
                            <i>You should also link your portfolio in the header where they can find your other projects.</i>
                            Having an impressive project that shows your expertise in a certain area showcases your abilities better than just listing skills.
                            Perhaps you had a final capstone project for your degree?

                        <p>
                            You should have enough spacing between every parts of text on your resume.
                            This ensures that your sections are clearly defined and text isn't crammed together.
                            <i>That being said, if you have a lot of empty white space for whatever reason, you may be wasting that space and could consider reformatting the whole resume entirely.</i>

                        <p>
                            If you are a student or recent graduate, your Education section should be at the top of your resume.
                            If you have little to no work experience, put your Projects section under your Education section.
                            If you are applying for a mid-level role or higher, your Work Experience section should be at the top of your resume, followed by Education.
